# okayreads_python
My final project for Champlain College's CSI-260: Advanced Python class. A reading tracker with user statistics. 

# Usage
The entirety of this program can be navigated through the command line. 

# Exporting / Saving
On the main interface there is an Export option. This will export your "Read" and "Want to Read" lists to a excel file to be used for other book trackig websites.

This is different from the "Save and Exit" function, this will save your data to a pickle file so the next time you run the program your books and username will be saved.
